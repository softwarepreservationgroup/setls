        SETLS v2.2 Installation Documentation

             The files from your SETLS distribution disk just need to be 
        copied to a user disk, then are ready for your use.


        Hard Disk Installation

             The SETLS files should normally be placed in a separate 
        subdirectory on a hard disk.  To do this, after booting your 
        system, just place your distribution disk in drive a:, then type 
        the following DOS commands: 

                cd \            - to make certain you're at the root
                md setls        - creates the subdirectory
                cd setls        - move into the new subdirectory
                copy a:*.*      - copy all the files to your hard disk

        In order to use SETLS, then, you may work within the setls 
        subdirectory.  However, you may prefer to have your source files 
        in another location.  To access SETLS, then, you should include 
        the \setls subdirectory on your path, with a DOS command such as:

                path c:\setls;c:\ed;c:\dos

        Here it is assumed that your (ASCII) editor is in c:\ed and that 
        you still want access to the DOS utilities in c:\dos.  Adjust 
        these as needed to fit the subdirectory names on your hard disk.


        Floppy disk installation

             To run SETLS from a floppy disk, just COPY all the files 
        from the distribution disk onto a formatted floppy disk.  If you 
        want to save space on the disk, the only file absolutely 
        necessary for execution is SETLS.EXE.  However, in order to be 
        able to create your source files, you should also have your 
        text editor on the floppy as well (If you use DVED, which is 
        provided, you need the file DVED.COM).  The other files are 
        documentation and examples (see the README file).
