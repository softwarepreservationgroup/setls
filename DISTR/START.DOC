                        Quick Start Information for SETLS

             The purpose of this document is to give you a quick 
        introduction to the use of SETLS.  For installation information, 
        see the file INSTALL.DOC.  And for a more detailed documentation 
        on SETLS, please refer to the file USER.DOC.

        Minimal files required for use of SETLS

             First boot your system with MS-DOS.  I'll assume that you 
        have already installed SETLS on either a floppy disk or hard 
        disk.  Then execution requires that you have in your directory 
        (or on your PATH) two things:

        (1)  An ASCII editor
             SETLS source programs must be simple ASCII text file.  The 
        editor DVED (Dewar Visual EDitor - the file DVED.COM) is provided 
        on the distribution disk for your convenience, if you wish to use 
        it.  You may, of course, use EDLIN, PC-WRITE, or other editor 
        which can create ASCII text.  If you use a word processor such as 
        Microsoft Word, be certain that you do NOT save it as a formatted 
        document, as the format codes will be interpreted by SETLS as 
        errors.  

        (2)  The SETLS Compiler
             The file SETLS.EXE contains the entire Compiler/Interpreter.  
        Once the SETLS source file is created, you only need this file to  
        compile and execute.


        Creating a Program

             You must first create your source code with your text 
        editor.  For this example, we will assume that DVED (the full-
        screen editor provided on your disk) is being used.  The normal 
        file extension for SETLS programs is .STL, hence we would start 
        the editor by typing at the system A> or C> prompt:
                                DVED HELLO.STL
        Then at the editor screen, type in the following program:
                        program hello;
                          print ('Hello, world!');
                        end;
        To close the editing session and save the file, use Alt-F1.  If 
        you check your directory, you should now have the file HELLO.STL.  
        (Note:  There is documentation provided for DVED on the 
        distribution disk.  Extensive help is also available while 
        editing, by using Ctrl-F1).


        Compiling-Executing your Program

             To execute your program, just type the command:
                                SETLS HELLO;
        The use of the semicolon provides that the compiler listing file 
        will automatically be placed in HELLO.LST.  The listing file will 
        contain any error messages (should they occur), along with 
        indications of line and statement numbers, to assist in finding 
        the problem.  It will also provide statistics on both the compile 
        and execution phases of SETLS.

             For further information on the compiler options, please see 
        the User's Guide for details.
