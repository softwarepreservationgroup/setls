        This diskette contains:

        README -- This file, describing the contents of this disk.

        SETLS.EXE -- the SETLS compiler.

        INSTALL.DOC -- documentation regarding the installation of SETLS 
            onto either a floppy disk or hard disk.  

        START.DOC -- provides a quick introduction to the use of SETLS.

        SETLS.DOC  -- This documentation provides an introduction to the 
            features of the SETLS compiler, including differences from 
            full SETL.  It also contains instructions on using the 
            compiler.  

        SETLSGRM.DOC -- This contains the SETLS grammar.  In case of 
            syntax errors, this may be a useful resource.

        As an introduction to the compiler, a number of .STL programs are 
            included.  These samples include SETLS versions of some of 
            the examples given in PROGRAMMING WITH SETS:  An Introduction 
            to SETL, by Schwartz, Dewar, Dubinsky, and Schonberg.  The 
            user may find it instructive to compare these programs with 
            the originals, in order to see some of the variations from 
            full SETL.  
                PRIME1.STL      (Dewar - list prime numbers)
                PRIME2.STL      (Sec. 2.4 - one line for primes)
                EULER.STL       (Sec. 11.1 - find Euler path)
                FACT.STL        (Sec. 4.4 - recursive factorial call)
                TOPSORT1.STL    (Sec. 11.2 - topological sort, ver. 1)
                TOPSORT2.STL    (Sec. 11.2 - topological sort, ver. 2)

        DVED.COM -- Dewar Visual EDitor, a full-screen text editor, which
            may be used to create your own SETLS source files.  This is
            provided for your convenience, though you may use any ASCII 
            text editor to create the .STL files.

        DVED.DOC & DVEDUSR.DOC -- documentation and keypad summary for the
            use of DVED.  Further help can be obtained during editing
            by use of Ctrl-F1.
